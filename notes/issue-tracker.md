# Issue Tracker

We are going to build an issue tracker application for a our fictional business.

The basic story is this:

"We want employees to be able to electronically file issues for software that they are assigned so that the
owner of that software can help them get on their feet again. 

The issues should be prioritized: Inconvenience, Work Stoppage, Customer Affected."
